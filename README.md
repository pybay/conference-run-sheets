# conference-run-sheets
This Python repo reads the PyBay conference schedule and speaker info from Sessionize, and generates concise run sheets - timelines that coordinate talk times, speakers and transitions, keeping everyone in sync and the conference on schedule. Used by Room Captains/Moderators, AV Teams, and event staff.
